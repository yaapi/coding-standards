YaAPI coding standard definition for [PHP Codesniffer](http://pear.php.net/PHP_CodeSniffer).
The PHP_CodeSniffer standard will never be 100% accurate, but should be viewed as a strong
set of guidelines while writing software for YaAPI.

The YaAPI coding standards are very similar to the [Joomla! Coding Standards](https://github.com/joomla/coding-standards)
with some minor changes.
